your readers’ actions: consider now, as you recall, look at the
next example .

•	 the logic and form of what you have written: first, second, to
begin, therefore, however, consequently . .

##	Delete meaningless words. 

Some words are verbal tics that we use as unconsciously as we clear our throats:
kind of|actually|particular|really|certain|various|virtually|individual|basically|generally|given|	 practically

##.	Delete doubled words. 

Early in the history of English,
writers got into the habit of pairing a French or Latin word
with a native English one, because foreign words sounded
more learned. Most paired words today are just redundant.
Among the common ones:

full and complete|hope and trust|any and all|true and accurate|each and every|basic and fundamental|hope and desire|first and foremost|various and sundry|true and accurate|

How to correct it: ** Choose the most precise term and delete the extra one**.
Example: Adrienne fulfilled all our hopes and dreams when she saved the whole entire planet.
Better example: Adrienne fullfilled all our hopes when she saved the planet.
# Delete what readers can infer. T

his redundancy is common
but hard to identify, because it comes in so many forms.
		
Redundant Modifiers Often, the meaning of a word
(italicized) ­implies its modifier (boldfaced):
	 Do not try to predict those future events that will completely
­ revolutionize society, because past history shows that it is the
final outcome of minor events that unexpectedly surprises us
more.
✓ 	 Do not try to predict revolutionary events, because history
shows that the outcome of minor events surprises us more.
Some common redundancies:
terrible tragedy|various different|free gift|basic fundamentals|future plans|each individual|final outcome|true facts|consensus of opinion|

The county manages education and public recreation.
Here are some general nouns (boldfaced) often used
redundantly:
large in size	 round in shape	 honest in character
unusual in nature	 of a strange type	 area of mathematics
of a bright color	 at an early time	 in a confused state

I compressed five phrases into five words:
carefully read what you have written	 >	edit
the thing to do before anything else	 >	first
use X instead of Y	 >	replace
nouns instead of verbs	 >	nominalizations
sequences of subjects and verbs	 >	clauses


5.	Change negatives to affirmatives. When you express an
idea in a negative form, not only must you use an extra word:
same S not different, but you also force readers to do a kind of
algebraic calculation. These two sentences, for example, mean
much the same thing, but the affirmative is more direct:
Do not write in the negative.  >  Write in the affirmative.
You can rewrite most negatives:
s is qual to >
not careful > careless not many > few
not the same S different not often S rarely
not allow S prevent not stop S continue
not notice S overlook not include S omit

Do not translate a negative into an affirmative if you want to
emphasize the negative. (Is that such a sentence? I could have
written, Keep a negative sentence when. . . .)
Some verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions are implicitly
negative:

Verbs preclude, prevent, lack, fail, doubt, reject, avoid,
deny, refuse, exclude, contradict, prohibit, bar
Prepositions without, against, lacking, but for, except
Conjunctions unless, except when

Some verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions are implicitly
negative:
Verbs  : preclude, prevent, lack, fail, doubt, reject, avoid,
deny, refuse, exclude, contradict, prohibit, bar
Prepositions : without, against, lacking, but for, except
Conjunctions unless, except when

You can baffle readers if you combine not with these
negative words. Compare these:
	 Except when you have failed to submit applications without
documentation, benefits will not be denied.
✓	 You will receive benefits only if you submit your documents.
✓	 To receive benefits, submit your documents.
