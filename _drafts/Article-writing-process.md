Process using outline:

make a sort of loose outline of the piece--just headers for each section with bullet points. Of course, I didn't know the info that would go into the bullet points, for a piece like you're writing they might be something like:

- Key benefit

- What sets it apart?

- Comparative pricing

- User ratings

Then, I'd go into the research looking for the answers to those questions, not engaging in open-ended learning.

Of course, there are more in-depth pieces where the open-ended learning is important, but very often it's not, and knowing the type of info you're seeking going in can really streamline

Alternative advice(https://www.reddit.com/r/freelanceWriters/comments/f5fvge/article_writers_whats_your_process/):
more information I do research. I just get all the notes down. Then I do what I call a brain dump and just type type type type type, usually what I have written is twice the size of what it needs to be for the piece. Once the brain dump is out I just start trimming the fat. Looking for better verbs, better adjectives, one word in place of three, and take out any redundancies and fluff. I always make sure I left a little bit of my attitude in the piece and call it a day.
