## Delete meaningless words.

Some words are verbal tics that we use as unconsciously as we clear our throats:
kind of|actually|particular|really|certain|various|virtually|individual|basically|generally|given| practically

##. Delete doubled words.

Early in the history of English,
writers got into the habit of pairing a French or Latin word
with a native English one, because foreign words sounded
more learned. Most paired words today are just redundant.
Among the common ones:

full and complete|hope and trust|any and all|true and accurate|each and every|basic and fundamental|hope and desire|first and foremost|various and sundry|true and accurate|

How to correct it: ** Choose the most precise term and delete the extra one**.
Example: Adrienne fulfilled all our hopes and dreams when she saved the whole entire planet.
Better example: Adrienne fullfilled all our hopes when she saved the planet.

# Delete what readers can infer. T

his redundancy is common
but hard to identify, because it comes in so many forms.
Redundant Modifiers Often, the meaning of a word
(italicized) ­implies its modifier (boldfaced):
Do not try to predict those future events that will completely
­ revolutionize society, because past history shows that it is the
final outcome of minor events that unexpectedly surprises us
more.
✓ Do not try to predict revolutionary events, because history
shows that the outcome of minor events surprises us more.
Some common redundancies:
terrible tragedy|various different|free gift|basic fundamentals|future plans|each individual|final outcome|true facts|consensus of opinion|

The county manages education and public recreation.
Here are some general nouns (boldfaced) often used
redundantly:
large in size round in shape honest in character
unusual in nature of a strange type area of mathematics
of a bright color at an early time in a confused state

I compressed five phrases into five words:
carefully read what you have written > edit
the thing to do before anything else > first
use X instead of Y > replace
nouns instead of verbs > nominalizations
sequences of subjects and verbs > clauses

5. Change negatives to affirmatives. When you express an
   idea in a negative form, not only must you use an extra word:
   same S not different, but you also force readers to do a kind of
   algebraic calculation. These two sentences, for example, mean
   much the same thing, but the affirmative is more direct:
   Do not write in the negative. > Write in the affirmative.
   You can rewrite most negatives:
   s is qual to >
   not careful > careless not many > few
   not the same S different not often S rarely
   not allow S prevent not stop S continue
   not notice S overlook not include S omit

Do not translate a negative into an affirmative if you want to
emphasize the negative. (Is that such a sentence? I could have
written, Keep a negative sentence when. . . .)
Some verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions are implicitly
negative:

Verbs preclude, prevent, lack, fail, doubt, reject, avoid,
deny, refuse, exclude, contradict, prohibit, bar
Prepositions without, against, lacking, but for, except
Conjunctions unless, except when

Some verbs, prepositions, and conjunctions are implicitly
negative:
Verbs : preclude, prevent, lack, fail, doubt, reject, avoid,
deny, refuse, exclude, contradict, prohibit, bar
Prepositions : without, against, lacking, but for, except
Conjunctions unless, except when

You can baffle readers if you combine not with these
negative words. Compare these:
Except when you have failed to submit applications without
documentation, benefits will not be denied.
✓ You will receive benefits only if you submit your documents.
✓ To receive benefits, submit your documents.

Here are some examples of words to keep an eye on (in addition to the qualifiers already listed above):

Basically
Essentially
Generally
Kind of
Mostly
Pretty
Rather
Slightly
Somewhat
Sort of
Various
Virtually

One way to cut the clutter in our writing is to eliminate repetitious expressions. Because we so often see and hear redundancies (such as "free gifts" and "foreign imports"), they can be easy to overlook. Therefore, when editing our work, we should be on the lookout for needless repetition and be ready to eliminate expressions that add nothing to what's been said.

Now does this mean that repetition must be avoided at all costs, or that good writers never repeat themselves? Certainly not. Careful repetition of key words and sentence structures can help establish clear connections in our writing. In effective rhetorical strategies of repetition, we consider how writers may rely on repetition to emphasize or clarify a central idea.

Our concern here is with eliminating needless repetition — redundant expressions that make writing longer, not better. Following are some of the common redundancies in English. In specific contexts, some of these phrases may serve a purpose. More often, however, the phrases weigh down our writing with unnecessary words. We can eliminate the needless repetition in each case by omitting the word or phrase in parentheses.

## AVoid using That 99% of the time

I've been writing and editing for a couple decades, and I can honestly say (that) professional editors will always cut "that" out of the pieces they edit. In all the writing I do, I leave it in about 5% of the time for one of two things: clarity or pacing. Go ahead and leave it in your draft, but when you're done, do a "find" and you'll realize that you don't need it 95% of the time if you've constructed your article correctly.

# advice

Then I sit down to write, and I usually try to write without interrupting myself. By that I mean, any images to be inserted, any word I can't remember, any resource I have to look up, I highlight in red. That way I can keep my train of thought and fill in the gaps later.

this, these, that, those,
another, such, second, or more

Check for the location of the following a sentence(Writers often refer to something in a pre­
vious sentence with words such as this, these, that, those,
another, such, second, or more. When you use any of those
signals, try to put them at or close to the beginning of a
