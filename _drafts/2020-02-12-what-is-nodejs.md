### What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript outside the browser. Node.js makes it possible to run JavaScript on the backend the same way other languages do such as Python, Php or Ruby.

Before node.js, JavaScript only executed in the browser. It all changed in 2009 when [Ryan Dahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) created Node.js by building it on top of  Google's V8 Engine. The V8 engine is the compiler used in Google Chrome and Chromium-based browsers to parse JavaScript.

### What is Node.js used for?
Node.js can be used to create the following:

- High-performance real-time applications such as chat apps that enable live transmission of video, text, or audio messages between users.
-  REST or GraphQl APIs
- Automation tools or build tools such as Webpack, Parcel.
- Cross-platform desktop applications using frameworks such as Electron.
- Internet of Things(IOT) sytems. IOT is a system where devices such as alarms, sensors, refrigerators can transfer and exchange data over a network without requiring human-to-computer interaction.

### Who uses Node.js?
Here are some of the companies currently using Node.js in production: 
- Netflix
- Microsoft
- Paypal
- IBM
